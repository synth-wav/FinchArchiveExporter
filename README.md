# Finch Archive Exporter

To use:
1. Export your data in the Finch app in Settings->Export Data (near the bottom)
2. Build the app
3. Unzip the resultant archive and acquire the file "Bullet.json." This contains the data for all of your entries, but isn't very readable.
4. Place Bullet.json in the app's directory and run via "ArchiveExporter.exe Bullet.json"
5. Your exported journaling data will output in a text file in the same directory "FinchArchiveExport[Date/Time].txt"
